# Sign Language Detection

This project describes a system that can detect sign language in real-time using TensorFlow and OpenCV. It achieves this by:

Building a model based on the "mobilenet-ssd" architecture, which is trained to identify objects within images.
Training this model specifically on a custom dataset of sign language images, created using tools like OpenCV and labelImg.
Running the trained model to detect sign language gestures in real-time.
